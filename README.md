### History

Version 1.0

- Only Star Wars `people` data API endpoint is catered for.
- Pagination functionality catered for `people` endpoints
- Since implementing pagination functionality above, navigating other character profile detail on following pages are not working correctly as SWAPI hasn't yet provided `id` property for any of its resource.

### TODOS

- ~~Add route/link to characters' planets/movies/trivia link content pages~~
- Add pagination components for characters/planets/movies etc
- ~~Make data saving capabilities to be persistent~~
- ~~Handle multi asynchronous requests logic~~ 
- ~~To decide whether I should use JSX instead of js moving forth~~
- Provide MongoDB service for hosting star wars images
- Refactored class-based components to make use of hooks
